üì∞ Fake News Detection System
Fake News Detection System is a machine learning-based web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify news content as Fake or Real. With the rapid spread of misinformation across digital platforms, especially on social media and unverified websites, it's crucial to have tools that assist users in identifying misleading or fabricated information.
This system empowers users‚Äîsuch as journalists, researchers, educators, and the general public‚Äîto verify the authenticity of news content by analyzing textual data. By training on a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles, the model learns linguistic patterns, keyword frequencies, and contextual features that help distinguish between genuine and deceptive information.
The application features a user-friendly web interface where users can paste any news content and receive an instant prediction. It is built using Python and Flask for the backend, with Scikit-learn for training and evaluating the machine learning model. Text pre-processing and feature extraction are handled using TF-IDF (Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency), which converts raw news text into numerical form suitable for machine learning models.
